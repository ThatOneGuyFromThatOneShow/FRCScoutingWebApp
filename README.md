# FRCScoutingWebApp
Server ready scouting app. I'd recommend you password protect the domain (It's pretty easy to wipe out all server data by modifying scripts or by creating a program ping the server).

I made a simple script in a few minutes; it will wipe out all the information in the team files (and replace it with "Hacked!" because we gotta have some fun). Using the same vulnerability I made a repair script that will repair any of the issues that I noted during the FRC STL Regional.
This repair script can be found in the Python Scripts folder.
